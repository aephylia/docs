The `audio` library lets you play sounds from your scripts. You can load WAV files from the workspace, generate simple beep tones, or stop all audio at once.

---

## Functions

### `audio.playSound(wavData, loop?)`

Plays a WAV file from raw binary data loaded into memory. Use `readfile()` to load the WAV data from your workspace first.

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `wavData` | string | — | Raw WAV file data (binary string) |
| `loop` | boolean | `false` | Whether to loop the sound continuously |

```lua
local wav = readfile("alert.wav")
audio.playSound(wav)

-- Loop background music
local bgm = readfile("music.wav")
audio.playSound(bgm, true)
```

<Warning>
  Only one sound can play at a time through `playSound`. Starting a new sound stops the previous one.
</Warning>

---

### `audio.beep(frequency, durationMs)`

Generates a simple sine-wave beep tone. This runs asynchronously on a separate thread, so it won't block your script.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `frequency` | number | Frequency in Hz (37–32767) |
| `durationMs` | number | How long to play in milliseconds |

```lua
-- Quick alert beep
audio.beep(800, 200)

-- Little musical sequence
audio.beep(523, 300) -- C
wait(0.35)
audio.beep(659, 300) -- E
wait(0.35)
audio.beep(784, 300) -- G
```

---

### `audio.stopAll()`

Immediately stops any sound currently playing.

```lua
audio.stopAll()
```

---

## Example — Alert Sound

```lua
-- Play an alert when a new player gets close
local alertSound = readfile("alert.wav")
local alerted = {}

while true do
    local players = Player.GetPlayers()
    for _, p in ipairs(players) do
        if p.IsAlive and not p.IsTeammate and p.Distance < 30 and not alerted[p.Name] then
            audio.playSound(alertSound)
            notify(p.Name .. " is close!", "Alert", 2, 3)
            alerted[p.Name] = true
        elseif p.Distance > 50 then
            alerted[p.Name] = nil
        end
    end
    wait(0.1)
end
```
