## Opening the script editor

Press the **Script Editor** button in the dock bar (or toggle it from the Settings tab) to open the built-in editor with syntax highlighting, tabs, and a console.

## Your first script

```lua
-- Hello world
print("Hello from aephylia!")
notify("Script loaded!", "aephylia", 3)
```

## Script lifecycle

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create">
    Click **+** in the script editor to create a new script, or load one from disk.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit">
    Write your Lua code in the editor. Syntax highlighting and auto-indentation are built in.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run">
    Click the **▶ Run** button. The script executes in a background thread with its own Lua state.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stop">
    Click **■ Stop** to request the script to halt. The engine checks a stop flag every 100 instructions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Script storage

Scripts are saved to `Documents\aephylia\scripts\*.lua` and persist between sessions.

## Key concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Background execution">
    Each script runs in its own thread with a fresh `lua_State`. Scripts don't block each other or the main render loop.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="wait() is required in loops">
    Always include `wait()` in `while true` loops. Without it, the script will consume 100% of a CPU core and can't be stopped.
    ```lua
    while true do
        -- your logic
        wait(0.01) -- 10ms, always include this
    end
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Thread safety">
    API calls that modify shared state (vars, draw buffers, notifications) are protected by mutexes. You don't need to worry about locking.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Sandboxing">
    File I/O is restricted to `Documents\aephylia\workspace`. Dangerous Lua standard library functions are removed.
  </Accordion>
