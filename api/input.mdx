The `Input` library is for **reading** (polling) key and mouse states. Want to check if a key is held down, or detect the exact moment someone presses a key? This is what you use.

For **simulating** input (moving the mouse, pressing keys), see [Raw Input](/api/raw-input).

## Functions

<ResponseField name="Input.IsKeyDown(keycode)" type="boolean">
  Returns `true` as long as the key is being held down. Fires continuously every frame the key is pressed.

  <ParamField path="keycode" type="number" required>
    [Virtual Key Code](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes)
  </ParamField>

  ```lua
  -- Check if W is held
  if Input.IsKeyDown(0x57) then
      print("Moving forward!")
  end
  ```
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Input.IsKeyPressed(keycode)" type="boolean">
  Returns `true` only on the **first frame** the key goes from up to down (rising edge). This is what you want for toggles — it only fires once per press, no matter how long you hold the key.

  <ParamField path="keycode" type="number" required>
    [Virtual Key Code](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/inputdev/virtual-key-codes)
  </ParamField>

  ```lua
  -- Toggle ESP with F5
  while true do
      if Input.IsKeyPressed(0x74) then -- F5
          local state = ESP.Toggle()
          notify(state and "ESP ON" or "ESP OFF", "Toggle", 2, 0)
      end
      wait(0.01)
  end
  ```
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Input.GetMousePosition()" type="table">
  Returns where the mouse cursor currently is on screen.

  **Returns:** `{ X: number, Y: number }`

  ```lua
  local mouse = Input.GetMousePosition()
  Draw.Circle(mouse.X, mouse.Y, 5, 255, 0, 0)
  ```
</ResponseField>

## Common Key Codes

| Key | Code | Key | Code |
|-----|------|-----|------|
| LMB | `0x01` | RMB | `0x02` |
| W | `0x57` | A | `0x41` |
| S | `0x53` | D | `0x44` |
| Space | `0x20` | Shift | `0x10` |
| Enter | `0x0D` | Escape | `0x1B` |
| Tab | `0x09` | Ctrl | `0x11` |
| 0–9 | `0x30`–`0x39` | F1–F12 | `0x70`–`0x7B` |

<Tip>
  Use `IsKeyPressed` for toggles and one-shot actions. Use `IsKeyDown` for continuous stuff like movement or "hold to activate."
