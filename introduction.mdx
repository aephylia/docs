<Note>
  **Security first:** `os`, `io`, `package`, `debug`, `dofile`, `loadfile`, `load`, and `loadstring` are all stripped after initialization. Your scripts run in a sandboxed environment — see [Security](/security) for the full details.
</Note>

## What is the aephylia Lua API?

aephylia comes with a built-in **LuaJIT** runtime that lets you write custom scripts to automate features, draw overlays, react to game events, and build entirely new functionality on top of the engine. Since LuaJIT compiles Lua to native machine code, your scripts run with near-C performance — no need to worry about scripting overhead.

Each script runs in its own **background thread** with a completely isolated state. You can start, stop, and edit scripts independently from the built-in script editor, and they won't interfere with each other or the main render loop.

        local state = ESP.Toggle()
        notify(state and "ON" or "OFF", "ESP", 1.5, state and 1 or 2)
    end
    wait(0.01)
end
```
