## Opening the script editor

Hit the **Script Editor** button in the dock bar (or toggle it from the Settings tab) to open the built-in editor. It's got syntax highlighting, tabs, and a console output panel — everything you need right there.

## Your first script

```lua
-- Hello world
print("Hello from aephylia!")
notify("Script loaded!", "aephylia", 3)
```

That's it! `print` writes to the console panel, and `notify` pops up a toast notification on your overlay.

## Script lifecycle

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create">
    Click **+** in the script editor to create a new script, or load one from disk.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit">
    Write your Lua code in the editor. Syntax highlighting and auto-indentation are built in.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run">
    Click **▶ Run**. Your script starts executing in a background thread with its own isolated Lua state.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stop">
    Click **■ Stop** to halt the script. The engine checks a stop flag every 100 instructions, so it'll stop within milliseconds.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Script storage

Your scripts are saved to `Documents\aephylia\scripts\*.lua` and persist between sessions — they'll be right where you left them next time you open aephylia.

## Things to keep in mind

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Scripts run in the background">
    Each script gets its own thread and a fresh `lua_State`. Scripts don't block each other or the main render loop, so you can run multiple scripts at once without issues.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Always use wait() in loops">
    If you have a `while true` loop, **always** include `wait()` in it. Without it, the script will eat an entire CPU core and can't be stopped cleanly.
    ```lua
    while true do
        -- your logic here
        wait(0.01) -- 10ms delay, always include this
    end
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Thread safety is handled for you">
    API calls that touch shared state (settings, draw buffers, notifications) are protected by mutexes internally. You don't need to worry about locking or race conditions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="File I/O is sandboxed">
    All file operations are restricted to `Documents\aephylia\workspace`. You can't escape the sandbox — see [Security](/security) for details.
  </Accordion>
