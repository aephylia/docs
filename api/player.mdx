The `Player` library is how you get information about everyone in the game — positions, health, distance, velocity, whether they're on your team, and more. You can also mark players as friendly so the aimbot ignores them.

---

## Local Player

<ResponseField name="Player.GetLocalPosition()" type="table">
  Returns your character's world position.

  **Returns:** `{ X: number, Y: number, Z: number }`

  ```lua
  local pos = Player.GetLocalPosition()
  print(pos.X, pos.Y, pos.Z)
  ```
</ResponseField>

## Player List

<ResponseField name="Player.GetPlayers()" type="table">
  Returns an array of all players currently cached in the game. This is the big one — gives you everything you need to know about every player.

  Each player entry contains:

  | Field | Type | Description |
  |-------|------|-------------|
  | `Name` | string | Username |
  | `DisplayName` | string | Display name |
  | `Health` | number | Current health |
  | `MaxHealth` | number | Maximum health |
  | `IsTeammate` | boolean | Whether they're on your team |
  | `Distance` | number | Distance from you in studs |
  | `UserId` | number | Roblox user ID |
  | `IsR6` | boolean | `true` if they're using the R6 rig |
  | `IsAephyliaUser` | boolean | `true` if they're running aephylia too |
  | `IsAlive` | boolean | `true` if the player is alive |
  | `Address` | number | Memory address (for advanced use) |
  | `Position` | table | `{ X, Y, Z }` — root part position |
  | `HeadPosition` | table | `{ X, Y, Z }` — head position |
  | `Velocity` | table | `{ X, Y, Z }` — movement velocity |

  ```lua
  local players = Player.GetPlayers()
  for _, p in ipairs(players) do
      if p.IsAlive and not p.IsTeammate then
          print(p.Name, p.Health .. "/" .. p.MaxHealth, math.floor(p.Distance) .. "m")
      end
  end
  ```
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Player.GetCount()" type="number">
  Returns how many players are currently cached. Quicker than doing `#Player.GetPlayers()` if you just need the count.
</ResponseField>

## Lookup

<ResponseField name="Player.GetClosest(skipTeammates?)" type="table | nil">
  Finds and returns the closest player to you, or `nil` if nobody's around.

  <ParamField path="skipTeammates" type="boolean" default="false">
    Set to `true` to only consider enemies.
  </ParamField>

  **Returns:** `{ Name, DisplayName, Health, MaxHealth, Distance, IsTeammate, Address, IsAlive, Position }` or `nil`

  ```lua
  local closest = Player.GetClosest(true) -- enemies only
  if closest then
      print("Nearest enemy:", closest.Name, math.floor(closest.Distance) .. "m")
  end
  ```
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Player.GetByName(name)" type="table | nil">
  Looks up a specific player by their username or display name (case-sensitive).

  <ParamField path="name" type="string" required>
    The username or display name to search for.
  </ParamField>

  **Returns:** `{ Name, DisplayName, Health, MaxHealth, Distance, IsTeammate, Address, UserId, IsAlive, Position }` or `nil`

  ```lua
  local target = Player.GetByName("xXGamerXx")
  if target then
      print("Found:", target.Name, "HP:", target.Health, "Alive:", target.IsAlive)
  end
  ```
</ResponseField>

## Friendly System

Mark players as friendly so the aimbot won't target them. Useful for whitelisting friends in FFA games.

<ResponseField name="Player.SetFriendly(name)" type="boolean">
  Marks a player as friendly. Returns `true` if the player was found.

  <ParamField path="name" type="string" required>The player's username</ParamField>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Player.SetNeutral(name)" type="boolean">
  Removes the friendly mark from a player. Returns `true` if the player was found.

  <ParamField path="name" type="string" required>The player's username</ParamField>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Player.IsFriendly(name)" type="boolean">
  Checks whether a player is marked as friendly. Returns `false` if the player doesn't exist.

  <ParamField path="name" type="string" required>The player's username</ParamField>
</ResponseField>

```lua
-- Whitelist a friend
Player.SetFriendly("MyBestFriend")

-- Log all nearby enemies (excluding teammates and friendlies)
local players = Player.GetPlayers()
for _, p in ipairs(players) do
    if p.IsAlive and not p.IsTeammate and not Player.IsFriendly(p.Name) and p.Distance < 100 then
        print("[ENEMY]", p.Name, math.floor(p.Distance) .. "m")
    end
end
```
